/* This class knows how to map values to color.
 * There are 3 types of mapping:
 * 1: gradient - We use a min and max value (rangeMin, rangeMax) and two colors (minColor,
 * maxColor). getColor(rangeMin) will return minColor. getColor(rangeMax) will return maxColor. In
 * between, we perform linear interpolation. 2: map      - We use a fixed map to map values (int) to
 * color. The values are stored in colorMap. 3: complex  - We use a specific complex color gradient
 * for values from rangeMin to rangeMax. They are similar to the ones used in MATLAB. The are set by
 * name. supportedComplexTypes has a list of all supported types.
